        <h6><i>What?</i></h6>Seismic signals from glaciated regions can be studied to “hear” glacier movement, in events that are commonly referred to as icequakes. Icequakes can have a variety of sources, listed as event sources above. <br><br>
        <h6><i>Why?</i></h6> We made CryoSeisMap as a way to make the field of glacier seismology more accessible and open. Databases like CryoSeisMap also streamline the way that research is done by providing the comprehensive spatial and temporal context of a subject. As an example, from this analysis we could see that only one study in the past 70 years has married glacial seismology studies with data from Himalayan glaciers.<br><br>
        <h6><i>Who?</i></h6> CryoSeisMap was built by and for scientists interested in or already involved in glacier seismology research. <br><br>
        <h6><i>How?</i></h6> Below are the expanded definitions we used for deciding which studies fit into which category. For studies that did not outright say "This paper is specifically about calving processes in Greenland", we used these definitions to assign source type. We note that some studies covered multiple topics and/or the same topic but in multiple study sites. This is taken into account by tagging every study with all of the associated source types and event locations. After reviewing hundreds of studies, these source types were the most frequent ones identified, but are by no means all of the possible options.
        <br> <br> 
        <div id="whitebox"> 
                <ul>
          <li>Calving: per the definition, when chunks of ice break off at the terminus of ice.</li>
          <li>Surface crevassing/cracking: Referring to the generation of crevasses or cracks at the surface of the ice. Also encompasses serac and ice falls. </li>
          <li>Englacial: Concerning englacial processes such as sub-surface imaging, drainage pathways, firn densification, and more! Essentially anything that occurs between the surface and base. </li>
          <li>Basal (melt related): Focused on signals from subglacial drainage or anything melt related at the base.</li>
          <li>Basal (stick-slip): Focused on glacier motion at the bed.</li>
          <li>Icebergs: Icebergs are the result of calving. Any study to do with the noises ice makes post-calving. Typically double dipped with ocean/tidal interactions, as icebergs are heard in this domain.</li>
          <li>Ocean/tidal interactions: Anything to do with the tides or ice-ocean interactions.</li>
          <li>Teleseismic: tremors recorded in glacial environments caused by earthquakes a large distance away that are not at the site.</li>
          <li>General/review: review papers, discussions of general topics in the field, and unspecified event types which fit into the "general" category.</li>
        </ul>
        <i>A short note on event location specificity: To ensure that all event markers are displayed on the map, the original latitudes longitudes are used for inputs to our database, but a random number generator is used to then offset each event.</i>
